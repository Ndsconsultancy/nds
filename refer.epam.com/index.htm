companies refer their candidates for the positions. It is launched to attract and hire new employees. Program is intended to bring in the best possible talents for NDS. A referral reward payment will be made to non-NDSers for successful referrals, which means the candidate was hired by NDS.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our dedicated team delivers a high-touch process to ensure the best possible candidate experience for your friends, relatives, classmates, and former colleagues. Referrals who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Referral Policy below will be interviewed and matched to vacancies, and you&#39;ll be kept up to date on their progress. If your Referral is hired to NDS, you may qualify for a Referral reward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;1. SCOPE&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Referral Policy below is designed to communicate the NDS Referral Program terms, conditions and associated reward bonus payments. This policy applies to all people who are not the part of NDS companies.\r\nBy submitting a referral to NDS, you are committing that you have the referred individual&#39;s consent to share their personal data and CV with NDS. All personal data of applicants shall be processed in accordance with our &lt;a href=\&quot;/applicant-privacy-notice\&quot;&gt;Applicant Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referral: Individuals within your network whose qualifications you know firsthand and who are aware they are being referred to NDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Examples include but are not limited to: Friends, former colleagues, relatives, classmates, or someone in your personal or professional network.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* TA Leadership reserves the right to reject Referrals at any time. Should you have questions about the eligibility of your referral, please reach out to &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;This referral program is applicable to roles as advertised under the &#39;Refer to NDS program&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For each successful referral, where candidate is hired and meets additional local conditions, a sum will be paid or a reward will be assigned to the referrer based on the location of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referral reward amount depends on the level of the referred individual at the time of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;All referral reward amounts will be made in local national currency of the location of hire and are subject to applicable local taxes, where applicable. However, unless stipulated otherwise, it is the referrer&#39;s responsibility to report this bonus to the relevant tax authority, if required. In\r\nother words, if any tax expense arises out of this bonus payment, the referrer/recipient is solely responsible to settle it without any further involvement from NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For payments to be processed, all individuals who earn a reward through NDS&#39;s referral program are required to provide the required information within 30 days of being notified by NDS of eligibility for a reward. If the information is not provided within 30 days, the reward will expire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;NDS may require additional information to process the payment and failure to provide such information may result in a delay or cancellation of the reward payment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;You will be notified by our &#39;Refer to NDS&#39; team if your referral is hired.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt; To be eligible for a reward: (i) your referral must be placed into an active hiring process within 30 days from the date NDS received your referral, and (ii) your referral must then be hired as a direct result of that hiring process. If the referred\r\nindividual is not entered into an active hiring process within 30 days, or becomes unresponsive for a period of greater than 30 days during the hiring process, then the referral no longer qualifies under this program, even if the hiring process is started or\r\nresumed at a later time.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;Submitting a referral does not create or imply any type of employment or other relationship between NDS and the referrer. The referrer is not authorised to make any representations, offers or other comments on behalf of NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referrer warrants that he/she by referring this candidate, they are not acting in breach of express or implied without employment or other obligations owed to third parties.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;In case of a cross-country referral, when the referrer&#39;s country differs from the country to which the referred individual is hired, referrals are paid according to the scheme of the target location where the candidate is hired. The country to which the referral is hired is responsible to pay the referral bonus.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n \r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;3. REFERRAL REWARD ELIGIBILITY&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.1 The referrer is ineligible for a reward payment if:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has communicated directly or indirectly with NDS regarding a career opportunity in the previous 90 days before the date of referral. The validity of this condition will be checked against our records under\r\nNDS&#39;s applicant tracking system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual was previously submitted to NDS by an approved staffing agency or under NDS&#39;s Employee Referral scheme in the previous six (6) months.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is not admitted to recruiting process on verification stage.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual was submitted to NDS by an approved source (external user, NDS employee, recruiting agency\r\netc.) and the previous recommendation is still valid.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has been referred by another person within the last six (6) months.&lt;/li&gt;      \r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has worked for NDS during within the last six (6) months and is eligible for rehire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is evaluated and hired as Junior.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is hired into an internship, entry level program, temporary role or any non-eligible roles, as set out in location Program Guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual does not have first-hand personal and/or professional knowledge of the individual being referred and is unable to provide their personal contact information and/or resume.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual works for an NDS client or partner where there is a current no-hire or non-solicitation agreement.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is contractually prohibited from making the referral (ex: based on a non-solicitation agreement).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is initially hired into temporary or part-time role, or to an internship, co-op, or any of NDS&#39;s entrylevel programs. If the candidate later joins NDS as a full-time employee, the referrer stays ineligible for a referral award.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is recommending themselves to NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual does not have permission to work fulltime in the location of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is ineligible for hire based on current labour laws. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is an NDS employee or independent consultant.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is an immediate family member of an NDS employee who is a: Member of the Talent Acquisition, Staffing, Human Resources team or Resource Manager/Unit Manager of the role being filled.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is not enough information in the referral to contact the candidate. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual requests that their personal data be obfuscated.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Examples of Non-compliant Referrals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The following list provides examples of some improper actions under the referral program that, when taken by an individual referrer, will result in rejection of the referral, or loss of any bonus:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; Providing Confidential Information: Sharing NDS confidential/private information with a referral or otherwise manipulating NDS&#39;s recruiting systems or processes to influence the hiring process.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Direct Influence on Hiring Process: Taking any steps towards or directly influencing NDS&#39;s hiring process outcomes for the referred candidate.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Abuse of Referral Systems: Engaging in practices aimed at artificially inflating referral numbers or otherwise gaming NDS&#39;s Referral bonus policies.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provision of Incorrect Information: Deliberately providing false or misleading information about a referral or yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Social Media Manipulation: Creating or supplying mass, unusually large, or undifferentiated numbers of referrals through manipulation of social media platforms.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Creation of Harassing Mechanisms: Developing or deploying mechanisms designed to disrupt the functioning of the referral system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undue Influence: Employing coercion or manipulation to influence referral outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consequences for Non-compliant Referrals: any individual who participates in or provides Non-compliant Referrals will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the policy and in accordance with local laws. Consequences may include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Immediate rejection of the referral and forfeiture of any associated referral bonuses or rewards.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n       \r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.2 Referral Verification: Change of Referral Reward Eligibility Decision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A change can be made in Referral Reward eligibility due to the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual&#39;s level was changed after a recruiter&#39;s/manager&#39;s assessment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the referred individual does not meet the criteria for the NDS Referral Program, you are not eligible for a Referral reward.&lt;/b&gt; All eligibility will be determined by TA Leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referral is hired into a temporary, part-time, or entry-level role, or an internship, or a non-eligible role. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is an ownership dispute over the referred individual. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;4. DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At NDS, we make employment decisions fairly and objectively based on capabilities and performance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;We encourage referrals from all different backgrounds and cultures and embrace their differences in gender identity or expression, race, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veteran status, and other characteristics that make them unique.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;If you would like to learn more about Diversity and Inclusion here at NDS, click &lt;a href=\&quot;/about/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility/social-responsibility/social\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;5. REFERRAL REWARD PAYMENT CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Participants are eligible for a referral reward if all the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is a valid referral profile from the referrer. The referral can be extended at the discretion of TA leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Ownership will be extended when Referral is part of a long hiring process including H1B Lottery campaigns. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is someone whose qualifications the referring employee knows firsthand, and who was aware they were referred to NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At the time of referral reward payment, the referred individual must be employed with NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n           \r\n           \r\n            &lt;li&gt;If the referrer submits the referral while they are onboarding with NDS, the referral will be accepted and considered an employee referral. The referrer is bonus eligible under the NDS Referral Program prior to their start date, and after the referrer joins NDS they will be eligible for the Employee Referral Program. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n    &lt;li&gt;Referral reward processing begins according to the terms defined by a location.&lt;/li&gt;    \r\n   \r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;6.

Will I be informed of the status of my referral throughout the recruiting process? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive periodic email updates from Auto Referral on your referral&#39;s status throughout the recruiting process. You can also view their status in the “My Referrals” section of the portal. If you haven&#39;t heard from us or have questions, please email &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;, with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. What should I do if my referral tells me they have not been contacted? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please email the referral team at &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt; with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. How will I know if my referral has been hired? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive an update via email from Auto Referral throughout your referral&#39;s recruiting process. You will be updated when they receive our offer, as well as when they accept our offer and when they join NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Why should I submit my referral through invite.epam.com instead of sharing the resume with recruiters or hiring managers I know? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Submitting your referral directly to invite.epam.com will guarantee that you are the referring individual, ensure you receive status updates, and allow you to receive a bonus reward if applicable. Your name will remain as the referring individual for one month from the submission date. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. What are the standard bonus awards amounts for a successfully hired referral? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of your bonus depends on candidate level (see &#39;Bonuses&#39; section) &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. If my referral is hired, when will I receive my referral bonus award? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The referral team will process your bonus payment within the first 30 days of your referral&#39;s start date with NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Can I recommend a candidate from another country to Argentina? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes! No matter your office location, referring talented individuals builds a better NDS and helps us grow as an organization.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. What if my referral&#39;s primary skill is wrong or unavailable? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your referral&#39;s resume acts as our main source in finding them the best opportunity for a successful career. Also, regardless of primary skill listed, we pre-screen all employee referrals to learn their true skills and preferences, and work to match them to opportunities at NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. How is the candidate&#39;s level determined?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The candidate&#39;s level is determined by the outcome of the hiring process - and results from the interviews assessing required skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11.  What if there are no suitable vacancies for the person I want to refer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If there are no suitable vacancies for the person you want to refer, you can still use the Invite portal to refer them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. What should I keep in mind when referring someone?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Verify that the candidate&#39;s contact (phone/e-mail) is available in their CV or provided in the submission form. It will help the TA (Talent Acquisition) team in reaching your candidate quicker.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Specify the correct “Primary Skill” for the candidate.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the candidate is aware of your referral and ready to consider opportunities at NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. What happens with my referral once it is checked for eligibility?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If your referral is verified from an eligibility point of view, it proceeds to the local TA team for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. How many interviews to expect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the role, there will be at least 2 interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;bonusesSectionText&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/content/dam/invite/TAM212952_Referral_Program_Email_Banner_09_24_2_opt2.jpg\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Have the best specialists in your network?

It is launched to attract and hire new employees. Program is intended to bring in the best possible talents for NDS. A referral reward payment will be made to non-NDSers for successful referrals, which means the candidate was hired by NDS.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our dedicated team delivers a high-touch process to ensure the best possible candidate experience for your friends, relatives, classmates, and former colleagues. Referrals who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Referral Policy below will be interviewed and matched to vacancies, and you&#39;ll be kept up to date on their progress. If your Referral is hired to NDS, you may qualify for a Referral reward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;1. SCOPE&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Referral Policy below is designed to communicate the NDS Referral Program terms, conditions and associated reward bonus payments. This policy applies to all people who are not the part of NDS companies.\r\nBy submitting a referral to NDS, you are committing that you have the referred individual&#39;s consent to share their personal data and CV with NDS. All personal data of applicants shall be processed in accordance with our &lt;a href=\&quot;/applicant-privacy-notice\&quot;&gt;Applicant Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referral: Individuals within your network whose qualifications you know firsthand and who are aware they are being referred to NDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Examples include but are not limited to: Friends, former colleagues, relatives, classmates, or someone in your personal or professional network.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* TA Leadership reserves the right to reject Referrals at any time. Should you have questions about the eligibility of your referral, please reach out to &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;This referral program is applicable to roles as advertised under the &#39;Refer to NDS program&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For each successful referral, where candidate is hired and meets additional local conditions, a sum will be paid or a reward will be assigned to the referrer based on the location of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referral reward amount depends on the level of the referred individual at the time of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;All referral reward amounts will be made in local national currency of the location of hire and are subject to applicable local taxes, where applicable. However, unless stipulated otherwise, it is the referrer&#39;s responsibility to report this bonus to the relevant tax authority, if required. In\r\nother words, if any tax expense arises out of this bonus payment, the referrer/recipient is solely responsible to settle it without any further involvement from NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For payments to be processed, all individuals who earn a reward through NDS&#39;s referral program are required to provide the required information within 30 days of being notified by NDS of eligibility for a reward. If the information is not provided within 30 days, the reward will expire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;NDS may require additional information to process the payment and failure to provide such information may result in a delay or cancellation of the reward payment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;You will be notified by our &#39;Refer to NDS&#39; team if your referral is hired.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt; To be eligible for a reward: (i) your referral must be placed into an active hiring process within 30 days from the date NDS received your referral, and (ii) your referral must then be hired as a direct result of that hiring process. If the referred\r\nindividual is not entered into an active hiring process within 30 days, or becomes unresponsive for a period of greater than 30 days during the hiring process, then the referral no longer qualifies under this program, even if the hiring process is started or\r\nresumed at a later time.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;Submitting a referral does not create or imply any type of employment or other relationship between NDS and the referrer. The referrer is not authorised to make any representations, offers or other comments on behalf of NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referrer warrants that he/she by referring this candidate, they are not acting in breach of express or implied without employment or other obligations owed to third parties.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;In case of a cross-country referral, when the referrer&#39;s country differs from the country to which the referred individual is hired, referrals are paid according to the scheme of the target location where the candidate is hired. The country to which the referral is hired is responsible to pay the referral bonus.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n \r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;3. REFERRAL REWARD ELIGIBILITY&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.1 The referrer is ineligible for a reward payment if:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has communicated directly or indirectly with NDS regarding a career opportunity in the previous 90 days before the date of referral.

DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At NDS, we make employment decisions fairly and objectively based on capabilities and performance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;We encourage referrals from all different backgrounds and cultures and embrace their differences in gender identity or expression, race, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veteran status, and other characteristics that make them unique.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;If you would like to learn more about Diversity and Inclusion here at NDS, click &lt;a href=\&quot;/about/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility/social-responsibility/social\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;5. REFERRAL REWARD PAYMENT CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Participants are eligible for a referral reward if all the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is a valid referral profile from the referrer. The referral can be extended at the discretion of TA leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Ownership will be extended when Referral is part of a long hiring process including H1B Lottery campaigns. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is someone whose qualifications the referring employee knows firsthand, and who was aware they were referred to NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At the time of referral reward payment, the referred individual must be employed with NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n           \r\n           \r\n            &lt;li&gt;If the referrer submits the referral while they are onboarding with NDS, the referral will be accepted and considered an employee referral. The referrer is bonus eligible under the NDS Referral Program prior to their start date, and after the referrer joins NDS they will be eligible for the Employee Referral Program. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n    &lt;li&gt;Referral reward processing begins according to the terms defined by a location.&lt;/li&gt;    \r\n   \r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;6. NOTES ON POLICY&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;NDS Talent Acquisition Leadership has the right to determine eligibility and payments of all referrals in question in its sole discretion. The program may be withdrawn by NDS at any time, without prior notification.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;affiliateLinkSectionText&quot;:[0,null],&quot;whyEpamFileUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;/about&quot;],&quot;openPositionTable&quot;:[0,null],&quot;faqSectionText&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/content/dam/invite/TAM212952_Referral_Program_Email_Banner_09_24_2_opt2.jpg\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p align=\&quot;center\&quot; font-size:40px\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. How long does it take to process a referral?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please expect your referral to be verified within three business days of their profile being created. One of our Referral Team Members or Recruiters will be contacting your referral within 3-5 days of verification.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Will I be informed of the status of my referral throughout the recruiting process? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive periodic email updates from Auto Referral on your referral&#39;s status throughout the recruiting process. You can also view their status in the “My Referrals” section of the portal. If you haven&#39;t heard from us or have questions, please email &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;, with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. What should I do if my referral tells me they have not been contacted? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please email the referral team at &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt; with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. How will I know if my referral has been hired? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive an update via email from Auto Referral throughout your referral&#39;s recruiting process. You will be updated when they receive our offer, as well as when they accept our offer and when they join NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Why should I submit my referral through invite.epam.com instead of sharing the resume with recruiters or hiring managers I know? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Submitting your referral directly to invite.epam.com will guarantee that you are the referring individual, ensure you receive status updates, and allow you to receive a bonus reward if applicable. Your name will remain as the referring individual for one month from the submission date. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. What are the standard bonus awards amounts for a successfully hired referral? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of your bonus depends on candidate level (see &#39;Bonuses&#39; section) &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. If my referral is hired, when will I receive my referral bonus award? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The referral team will process your bonus payment within the first 30 days of your referral&#39;s start date with NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Can I recommend a candidate from another country to Argentina? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes! No matter your office location, referring talented individuals builds a better NDS and helps us grow as an organization.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. What if my referral&#39;s primary skill is wrong or unavailable? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your referral&#39;s resume acts as our main source in finding them the best opportunity for a successful career. Also, regardless of primary skill listed, we pre-screen all employee referrals to learn their true skills and preferences, and work to match them to opportunities at NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. How is the candidate&#39;s level determined?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The candidate&#39;s level is determined by the outcome of the hiring process - and results from the interviews assessing required skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11.  What if there are no suitable vacancies for the person I want to refer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If there are no suitable vacancies for the person you want to refer, you can still use the Invite portal to refer them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. What should I keep in mind when referring someone?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Verify that the candidate&#39;s contact (phone/e-mail) is available in their CV or provided in the submission form. It will help the TA (Talent Acquisition) team in reaching your candidate quicker.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Specify the correct “Primary Skill” for the candidate.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the candidate is aware of your referral and ready to consider opportunities at NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. What happens with my referral once it is checked for eligibility?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If your referral is verified from an eligibility point of view, it proceeds to the local TA team for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. How many interviews to expect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the role, there will be at least 2 interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;bonusesSectionText&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/content/dam/invite/TAM212952_Referral_Program_Email_Banner_09_24_2_opt2.jpg\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Have the best specialists in your network?

companies refer their candidates for the positions. It is launched to attract and hire new employees. Program is intended to bring in the best possible talents for NDS. A referral reward payment will be made to non-NDSers for successful referrals, which means the candidate was hired by NDS.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our dedicated team delivers a high-touch process to ensure the best possible candidate experience for your friends, relatives, classmates, and former colleagues. Referrals who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Referral Policy below will be interviewed and matched to vacancies, and you&#39;ll be kept up to date on their progress. If your Referral is hired to NDS, you may qualify for a Referral reward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;1. SCOPE&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Referral Policy below is designed to communicate the NDS Referral Program terms, conditions and associated reward bonus payments. This policy applies to all people who are not the part of NDS companies.\r\nBy submitting a referral to NDS, you are committing that you have the referred individual&#39;s consent to share their personal data and CV with NDS. All personal data of applicants shall be processed in accordance with our &lt;a href=\&quot;/applicant-privacy-notice\&quot;&gt;Applicant Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referral: Individuals within your network whose qualifications you know firsthand and who are aware they are being referred to NDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Examples include but are not limited to: Friends, former colleagues, relatives, classmates, or someone in your personal or professional network.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* TA Leadership reserves the right to reject Referrals at any time. Should you have questions about the eligibility of your referral, please reach out to &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;This referral program is applicable to roles as advertised under the &#39;Refer to NDS program&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For each successful referral, where candidate is hired and meets additional local conditions, a sum will be paid or a reward will be assigned to the referrer based on the location of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referral reward amount depends on the level of the referred individual at the time of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;All referral reward amounts will be made in local national currency of the location of hire and are subject to applicable local taxes, where applicable. However, unless stipulated otherwise, it is the referrer&#39;s responsibility to report this bonus to the relevant tax authority, if required. In\r\nother words, if any tax expense arises out of this bonus payment, the referrer/recipient is solely responsible to settle it without any further involvement from NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;For payments to be processed, all individuals who earn a reward through NDS&#39;s referral program are required to provide the required information within 30 days of being notified by NDS of eligibility for a reward. If the information is not provided within 30 days, the reward will expire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;NDS may require additional information to process the payment and failure to provide such information may result in a delay or cancellation of the reward payment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;You will be notified by our &#39;Refer to NDS&#39; team if your referral is hired.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt; To be eligible for a reward: (i) your referral must be placed into an active hiring process within 30 days from the date NDS received your referral, and (ii) your referral must then be hired as a direct result of that hiring process. If the referred\r\nindividual is not entered into an active hiring process within 30 days, or becomes unresponsive for a period of greater than 30 days during the hiring process, then the referral no longer qualifies under this program, even if the hiring process is started or\r\nresumed at a later time.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;Submitting a referral does not create or imply any type of employment or other relationship between NDS and the referrer. The referrer is not authorised to make any representations, offers or other comments on behalf of NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referrer warrants that he/she by referring this candidate, they are not acting in breach of express or implied without employment or other obligations owed to third parties.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;In case of a cross-country referral, when the referrer&#39;s country differs from the country to which the referred individual is hired, referrals are paid according to the scheme of the target location where the candidate is hired. The country to which the referral is hired is responsible to pay the referral bonus.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n \r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;3. REFERRAL REWARD ELIGIBILITY&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.1 The referrer is ineligible for a reward payment if:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has communicated directly or indirectly with NDS regarding a career opportunity in the previous 90 days before the date of referral. The validity of this condition will be checked against our records under\r\nNDS&#39;s applicant tracking system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual was previously submitted to NDS by an approved staffing agency or under NDS&#39;s Employee Referral scheme in the previous six (6) months.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is not admitted to recruiting process on verification stage.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual was submitted to NDS by an approved source (external user, NDS employee, recruiting agency\r\netc.) and the previous recommendation is still valid.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has been referred by another person within the last six (6) months.&lt;/li&gt;      \r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual has worked for NDS during within the last six (6) months and is eligible for rehire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is evaluated and hired as Junior.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n     &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is hired into an internship, entry level program, temporary role or any non-eligible roles, as set out in location Program Guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual does not have first-hand personal and/or professional knowledge of the individual being referred and is unable to provide their personal contact information and/or resume.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual works for an NDS client or partner where there is a current no-hire or non-solicitation agreement.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is contractually prohibited from making the referral (ex: based on a non-solicitation agreement).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is initially hired into temporary or part-time role, or to an internship, co-op, or any of NDS&#39;s entrylevel programs. If the candidate later joins NDS as a full-time employee, the referrer stays ineligible for a referral award.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is recommending themselves to NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual does not have permission to work fulltime in the location of hire.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is ineligible for hire based on current labour laws. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is an NDS employee or independent consultant.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referring individual is an immediate family member of an NDS employee who is a: Member of the Talent Acquisition, Staffing, Human Resources team or Resource Manager/Unit Manager of the role being filled.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is not enough information in the referral to contact the candidate. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual requests that their personal data be obfuscated.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Examples of Non-compliant Referrals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The following list provides examples of some improper actions under the referral program that, when taken by an individual referrer, will result in rejection of the referral, or loss of any bonus:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt; Providing Confidential Information: Sharing NDS confidential/private information with a referral or otherwise manipulating NDS&#39;s recruiting systems or processes to influence the hiring process.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Direct Influence on Hiring Process: Taking any steps towards or directly influencing NDS&#39;s hiring process outcomes for the referred candidate.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Abuse of Referral Systems: Engaging in practices aimed at artificially inflating referral numbers or otherwise gaming NDS&#39;s Referral bonus policies.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provision of Incorrect Information: Deliberately providing false or misleading information about a referral or yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Social Media Manipulation: Creating or supplying mass, unusually large, or undifferentiated numbers of referrals through manipulation of social media platforms.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Creation of Harassing Mechanisms: Developing or deploying mechanisms designed to disrupt the functioning of the referral system.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undue Influence: Employing coercion or manipulation to influence referral outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consequences for Non-compliant Referrals: any individual who participates in or provides Non-compliant Referrals will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the policy and in accordance with local laws. Consequences may include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Immediate rejection of the referral and forfeiture of any associated referral bonuses or rewards.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n       \r\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.2 Referral Verification: Change of Referral Reward Eligibility Decision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A change can be made in Referral Reward eligibility due to the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual&#39;s level was changed after a recruiter&#39;s/manager&#39;s assessment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the referred individual does not meet the criteria for the NDS Referral Program, you are not eligible for a Referral reward.&lt;/b&gt; All eligibility will be determined by TA Leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referral is hired into a temporary, part-time, or entry-level role, or an internship, or a non-eligible role. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is an ownership dispute over the referred individual. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;4. DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At NDS, we make employment decisions fairly and objectively based on capabilities and performance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;We encourage referrals from all different backgrounds and cultures and embrace their differences in gender identity or expression, race, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veteran status, and other characteristics that make them unique.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;If you would like to learn more about Diversity and Inclusion here at NDS, click &lt;a href=\&quot;/about/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility/social-responsibility/social\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;5. REFERRAL REWARD PAYMENT CONDITIONS&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Participants are eligible for a referral reward if all the following conditions are fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;There is a valid referral profile from the referrer. The referral can be extended at the discretion of TA leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;Ownership will be extended when Referral is part of a long hiring process including H1B Lottery campaigns. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;The referred individual is someone whose qualifications the referring employee knows firsthand, and who was aware they were referred to NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;At the time of referral reward payment, the referred individual must be employed with NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n           \r\n           \r\n            &lt;li&gt;If the referrer submits the referral while they are onboarding with NDS, the referral will be accepted and considered an employee referral. The referrer is bonus eligible under the NDS Referral Program prior to their start date, and after the referrer joins NDS they will be eligible for the Employee Referral Program. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n   \r\n    &lt;li&gt;Referral reward processing begins according to the terms defined by a location.&lt;/li&gt;    \r\n   \r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=\&quot;box1\&quot;&gt;6. NOTES ON POLICY&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;NDS Talent Acquisition Leadership has the right to determine eligibility and payments of all referrals in question in its sole discretion. The program may be withdrawn by NDS at any time, without prior notification.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;affiliateLinkSectionText&quot;:[0,null],&quot;whyEpamFileUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;/about&quot;],&quot;openPositionTable&quot;:[0,null],&quot;faqSectionText&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/content/dam/invite/TAM212952_Referral_Program_Email_Banner_09_24_2_opt2.jpg\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p align=\&quot;center\&quot; font-size:40px\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. How long does it take to process a referral?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please expect your referral to be verified within three business days of their profile being created. One of our Referral Team Members or Recruiters will be contacting your referral within 3-5 days of verification.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Will I be informed of the status of my referral throughout the recruiting process? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive periodic email updates from Auto Referral on your referral&#39;s status throughout the recruiting process. You can also view their status in the “My Referrals” section of the portal. If you haven&#39;t heard from us or have questions, please email &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt;, with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. What should I do if my referral tells me they have not been contacted? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please email the referral team at &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:ReferralAR@epam.com\&quot;&gt;ReferralAR@epam.com&lt;/a&gt; with your referral&#39;s full name and other identifying information (i.e. email address or LinkedIn profile). &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. How will I know if my referral has been hired? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive an update via email from Auto Referral throughout your referral&#39;s recruiting process. You will be updated when they receive our offer, as well as when they accept our offer and when they join NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Why should I submit my referral through invite.epam.com instead of sharing the resume with recruiters or hiring managers I know? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Submitting your referral directly to invite.epam.com will guarantee that you are the referring individual, ensure you receive status updates, and allow you to receive a bonus reward if applicable. Your name will remain as the referring individual for one month from the submission date. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. What are the standard bonus awards amounts for a successfully hired referral? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of your bonus depends on candidate level (see &#39;Bonuses&#39; section) &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. If my referral is hired, when will I receive my referral bonus award? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The referral team will process your bonus payment within the first 30 days of your referral&#39;s start date with NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Can I recommend a candidate from another country to Argentina? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes! No matter your office location, referring talented individuals builds a better NDS and helps us grow as an organization.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. What if my referral&#39;s primary skill is wrong or unavailable? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your referral&#39;s resume acts as our main source in finding them the best opportunity for a successful career. Also, regardless of primary skill listed, we pre-screen all employee referrals to learn their true skills and preferences, and work to match them to opportunities at NDS. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. How is the candidate&#39;s level determined?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The candidate&#39;s level is determined by the outcome of the hiring process - and results from the interviews assessing required skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11.  What if there are no suitable vacancies for the person I want to refer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If there are no suitable vacancies for the person you want to refer, you can still use the Invite portal to refer them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. What should I keep in mind when referring someone?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Verify that the candidate&#39;s contact (phone/e-mail) is available in their CV or provided in the submission form. It will help the TA (Talent Acquisition) team in reaching your candidate quicker.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Specify the correct “Primary Skill” for the candidate.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the candidate is aware of your referral and ready to consider opportunities at NDS.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. What happens with my referral once it is checked for eligibility?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If your referral is verified from an eligibility point of view, it proceeds to the local TA team for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. How many interviews to expect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the role, there will be at least 2 interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;bonusesSectionText&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/content/dam/invite/TAM212952_Referral_Program_Email_Banner_09_24_2_opt2.jpg\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Have the best specialists in your network?
